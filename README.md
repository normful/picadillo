**picadillo**
*noun*  \ˌpē-kə-ˈdē-(ˌ)yō\

1.  A ground meat dish cooked with tomatoes and seasonings, sometimes with
    potatoes, olives, or raisins; served on its own or as a filling.

2. *(tech slang)* A mix of pi coding agent extensions,
   skills, and commands combined into one cohesive workflow; modular,
   interoperable, and—depending on the build—
   - occasionally containing undocumented features
   - prone to “seasonal” bugs
   - held together by optimism and duct taped tokens

**Etymology:** From Spanish *picar* (“to mince, to chop”), from Vulgar Latin
*piccare* (“to pierce”). Folk etymology proposes a secondary meaning: “to
repeatedly poke reality until it tastes better.”

**Usage note:** May contain olives, raisins, or side effects.

```bash
pi install npm:@normful/picadillo
